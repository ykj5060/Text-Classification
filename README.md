# Linear Regression Presentation 
Welcome to the Linear Regression Presentation repository! This project showcases the application of linear regression to tackle real-world problems. Here, we'll dive deep into the nuances of both simple and multiple linear regression and address various challenges and considerations.

## Simple Linear Regression

## Multiple Linear Regression

### 1. Multicollinearity
Multicollinearity occurs when two or more independent variables in the model are highly correlated. This can inflate the variance of the coefficient estimates and make them unstable. Various techniques, like Variance Inflation Factor (VIF), can be used to detect multicollinearity.

### 2. Normality 
For valid hypothesis testing, the residuals (errors) should be approximately normally distributed. Techniques such as Q-Q plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test can be used to check for normality.

### 3. Heteroscedasticity
Heteroscedasticity refers to the condition where the variance of the residuals is not constant across all levels of the independent variables. This can be detected using scatter plots or tests like the Breusch-Pagan test.

### 4. Influentia Points
Influential points are data points that have a disproportionate influence on the regression line. Identifying and addressing these points is crucial, as they can skew results. Measures like Cook's Distance can help identify these points.
